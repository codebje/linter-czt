# linter-czt package

Lint Z specifications with the Community Zed Toolkit.

Included is a binary distribution of the CZT checker, compiled with a patch to include triggering error length information.  The source for CZT is available online at http://czt.sourceforge.net/, and the patch is included in this package's distribution and source.

Only Z syntax is currently supported.

To enable this linter, either name your file with a 'zed' extension, put '% !Z-notation' as the first line in your 'tex' file, or select the 'LaTeX Z' grammar from the grammar list.
